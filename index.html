        The sun was already halfway down, steadily sinking toward the horizon,
        which was barely visible behind the tall new buildings. The city
        itself was quite large and filled with noise: people talking and
        rushing along the streets, trying to catch the morning or evening bus,
        restless traffic capable of causing annoying traffic jams, and office
        centers that had become a familiar sight to the residents themselves.
        That evening, John didn't order anything, anticipating a dinner
        without delivery and extra people — he headed to his favorite local
        cafe. The summer rays warmed the young man's head a little, but he
        didn't need a hat, whether it was a panama hat or a cap. The young man
        didn't have a neat hairstyle, and to many it might have seemed
        completely unkempt (but who cares about them?), which, however, was
        not true: John spent a decent portion of his income on personal care,
        including his hair, but he simply didn't bother styling it, because it
        was a waste of time — and he preferred it tousled rather than slicked
        back or neatly combed. A pleasant bonus of the hair care products was
        that after the procedure, there was a pleasant apricot scent.
        Surprisingly, there was no oppressive heat among the wide city
        streets, so the guy felt comfortable in a standard-cut pastel orange
        cotton shirt, dark brown knee-length shorts, and his usual orange
        sunglasses. And thanks to the mild weather, which did not make him
        suffocate from the heat, the guy was able to wear sneakers that
        matched his shirt, complemented by high white socks. Walking along his
        familiar route, passing people, he made it to the café. As luck would
        have it, it was closed for “technical maintenance” — the sign on the
        door seemed to mock him silently. John rolled his eyes, mentally
        regretting not ordering delivery.
